- **✅ Processing rate**: ~11.5 texts/second
- **✅ Similarity calculations**: Working correctly with semantic understanding

### 3. Fixed Import Issues
- **✅ Created proper `__init__.py` files** for both `data-ingest/` and `vector-service/`
- **✅ Fixed `create_embedding_service` function** that was missing
- **✅ Fixed Path object handling** for cache directories
- **✅ Resolved ChromaDB embedding dimension conflicts** (384 vs 1024)

### 4. ChromaDB Integration Fixes
- **✅ Created custom Jina embedding function** for ChromaDB
- **✅ Fixed embedding function signature** to match ChromaDB requirements
- **✅ Resolved singleton instance conflicts** in testing
- **✅ Vector storage and retrieval working** with correct 1024-dimensional embeddings
